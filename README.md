# storage_app

This proyect is based on a [dbstech video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIZ3Vx-5-TU)
with some own modifications such as the structure and other things,
this due to personal preferences.

## Getting Started

At this point the app is at initial base with a [route]('./lib/router/app_routes.dart') and [theme](./lib/themes/app_theme.dart) manager in
order to have a better management of its structure.


### [Router]('./lib/router/app_routes.dart')
In this file a structure is defined where we can add the different routes and the different screens(widgets) to which they point.
